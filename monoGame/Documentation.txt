1.Treasure Detection:1) the npagent detect the treasure if it is in 4000 pixel area.
	2)at the beginning npagent starts with a random waypoint
	3)npagent stopes it all treasure are tagged
	4)with hitting “N” it turn to a treasure and comeback
	5)with pressing I you can see the player and npagent scores
	6)npagent is collidable
2.Obstacle avoidance:1)I used bounding sphere for Obstacle avoidance.
	2)FSM diagram is 
		if right sensor is on turn right 0.1f
		if left sensor is on left right 0.1f
	3)sensors will change to invisible with "z" and visible this pressing "z" again.
	4)I made a class sensor with a sphere model for the sensors and any obstacle that goes to 450 pixel near the sensors npagent will turn with the FSM diagram.
		and we can turn the sensors off with changing the isCollidable to false in sensor class.
	5)I use the npagent forward vector to add to the npanget position with a multiplayer to be in front of the npagent.
	6)for the right sensor i added the npagent's right vector with a multiplayer to the sensors position.
	7)left sensor is the same as right sensor but using the right vector of np agent.
	
3.flocking: 1)I used the same algorithm in the slides and I have 4 flocking level and we can change it with "p" and it shows the percentage in "I" section.
	2)I made the flocking in the player class and I used position of the player for flocking.
	3)I used dogs positions to make them to hit each other.
	4)with more level of flocking i used less random force for the doges and more steps to the players position.
	5)and if doges be close to each other they with go to opposite direction.
